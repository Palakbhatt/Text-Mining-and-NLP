# Text-Mining-and-NLP
This repository will provide you with a comprehensive and detailed knowledge of Natural Language Processing, popularly known as NLP. It also contains different steps involved in processing the human language like Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization and much more along with a demo on each one of the topics. 

The following topics covered :

1. The Evolution of Human Language
2. What is Text Mining?
3. What is Natural Language Processing?
4. Applications of NLP
5. NLP Components and Demo

Natural Language Processing (or Text Analytics/Text Mining) applies analytic tools to learn from collections of text data, like social media, books, newspapers, emails, etc. The goal can be considered to be similar to humans learning by reading such material. However, using automated algorithms we can learn from massive amounts of text, very much more than a human can. It is bringing a new revolution by giving rise to chatbots and virtual assistants to help one system address queries of millions of users.

NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans interact. Human language, developed over thousands and thousands of years, has become a nuanced form of communication that carries a wealth of information that often transcends the words alone. NLP will become an important technology in bridging the gap between human communication and digital data.
